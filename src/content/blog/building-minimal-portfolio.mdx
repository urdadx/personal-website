When building a portfolio site, it’s easy to overdo it. You start with a simple idea, add animations and complex layouts, and before long, you’ve built something that loads slowly and is hard to maintain.

I wanted something else. Something that loads fast, looks clean, and stays focused on the content.

## The Stack

This portfolio is built with [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start), a full-stack React framework with file-based routing and server-side rendering. For styling, I use [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com) and [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) components.

The site is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev). Blog posts are plain markdown files, parsed with [gray-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter) and rendered using [react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown).

## Why TanStack Start

I chose TanStack Start over Next.js because it gives me more control with less magic. The mental model feels closer to standard React, and I don’t have to work around framework-specific conventions as often.

Data fetching, routing, and server logic feel explicit instead of hidden. It’s easier to understand what runs on the server and what runs on the client, which makes the app simpler to reason about.

For a small portfolio, Next.js can feel heavy. TanStack Start stays lightweight, fast, and flexible without getting in the way.

## Performance

The site scores 100 on all Lighthouse metrics. Server-side rendering gives a fast first paint, and optimized font loading keeps things quick.

## What’s Next

I plan to write more about building products, solving technical problems and life in general so stay tuned.
